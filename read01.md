## API types:

there are four types of API principals commonly used in web aplications **(public, partner, private and composite)** , the main usage of APIs is to connect the users interface(front end) with the back end functionalitys and information, plus it could be used to stream aplications, online payment such as paypal transactions, loggin in using XYZ and the constant update of weather snippets and any sudden change in the forcast.

### **API pros:**

**pros:**

- Connecting disparate software applications for a stronger overall product offering.

- Shortening the development cycle through automation.

- Reducing resources that would otherwise need to be allocated for in house work.

- Improving brand recognition and trust.

- Providing new services to end users with maximum efficiency.

### **SDK pros:**

- **Access to constituent parts and instructions for software development:** A retail SDK, for example, that pulls in all the things you’d want in your app.

- **better integrations:** SDKs makes it easier to standard processes needed and provide ready access to information wanted.

- **Shorter development cycle, getting products deployed create a better efficiently:** Because an SDK is built to inform, equip and give shortcuts to development, developers can focus on developing the product they’ve been working on.

- **Built-in support and expertise:** No need to search for answers or hire out to augment your team, SDKs come pre loaded with expertise in the code already written and the support documentation included.

- **Cost control:** All of the above enable you to better adhere to an established budget during development and post-deployment.

### so you have to pick only one of them?

the answer is no, SDK often contains at least one API. These two help you in different ways but can and do work together.

APIs serve to define how different platforms work together. They facilitate interaction along with protocols; and as facilitators, they serve as one of the tools in a complete kit.
